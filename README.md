# Change-layout-keyboard-
Small script to change the layout of your keyboard( to any other keyboard layout, in this case to an eu layout) when you run the terminal.

Steps:
1.- Open your terminal (type 'Crtl' + 'Alt' + 't')\n
2.- Introduce in your terminal "nano .bashrc"
3.- Go to the last line and write a short descriptiom of the action you are going to write on the next line (with a #)
4.- Write the command "setxkbmap -layout eu" (If you want any other layout, just change eu for the shortcut of the coumtry layout you want)
5.- If you are using nano, type "Ctrl" + "o", to save and "Ctrl" + "x" to exit nano.
5.1 - If you are using vim, press "Esc", then type ":wq" to save and exit.


That will be all!!
